# JS-Calculator
A calculator that can do simple arithmetic with use of single bracket pairs and incorporating the correct order of operations

I used this project to help my practice my JavaScript and learn how to manipulate strings and perfrom calculations and have them displayed in the browser for the user.
I did this mainly from scratch to try and undertand how to do each part myself.

There may still be some bugs, feedback is appreciated.
