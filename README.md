# JS-Calculator - MIGRATED TO "adam-selman"
A calculator that can do simple arithmetic with brackets incorporates the correct order of operations.

I used this project to help my practice my JavaScript and learn how to manipulate strings and perfrom calculations and have them displayed in the browser for the user.
I did this mainly from scratch to try and undertand how to do each part myself.

There may still be some bugs, feedback is appreciated.
